Relational databases are my foundation: MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQL Server, SQLite. But I'm not limited to that. If the project demands NoSQL, message brokers, or distributed architecture, I'm in.",
    "paragraph2": "I build REST APIs that come with versioned OpenAPI contracts, automated test suites, and documentation any dev can understand. I work with enterprise SSO, message queues, webhooks, and integrations between legacy and modern systems. Security is a baseline requirement: I implement LGPD compliance by default, layered encryption, and auditable logs that survive any external audit. At Fábrica de Tecnologias Turing and FAB projects, I learned that good code is code another dev can maintain three years later without calling me at 2 AM.",
    "paragraph3": "I collaborate directly with designers, product owners, and even legal when projects require it. I like releases that ship with clear metrics, documented SLAs, and observability from the first commit. My goal isn't just to deliver — it's to deliver something that scales, handles real traffic, and passes compliance without surprises."
